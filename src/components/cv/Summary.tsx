                    A Frontend Engineer with a{" "}
                    <span className="font-bold">&quot;product-owner&quot;</span>{" "}
                    mindset, shaped by over five years of experience across the
                    full development stack. I specialize in architecting
                    high-performance{" "}
                    <span className="font-bold">web and mobile ecosystems</span>{" "}
                    that bridge the gap between complex backend logic and
                    intuitive, immersive user experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My technical foundation is built on{" "}
                    <span className="font-bold">TypeScript</span> and modern
                    frameworks like <span className="font-bold">Next.js</span>{" "}
                    and <span className="font-bold">React</span>, but I
                    differentiate myself through creative engineering using
                    tools like Three.js to build interactive 3D environments and
                    Tailwind to build scalable design systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My approach is defined by technical versatility:{" "}
                    <span className="font-bold">
                        I don’t just write code; I design systems.
                    </span>{" "}
                    From wireframing high-fidelity prototypes in{" "}
                    <span className="font-bold">Figma</span> to orchestrating
                    containerized deployments and{" "}
                    <span className="font-bold">CI/CD pipelines</span>, I ensure
                    every application is secure, performant, and maintainable. I
                    thrive in Agile environments where I can mentor
                    cross-functional teams, leverage{" "}
                    <span className="font-bold">AI-assisted tooling</span> to
                    accelerate delivery, and translate high-level business goals
                    into robust technical reality.
