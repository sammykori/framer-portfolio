                There are moments in a creative journey that quietly mark a
                turning point. You don’t always realise it at first—but looking
                back, everything after feels slightly different.

            <p>For us, Re:Connect Conference 2025 was one of those moments.</p>
            <p>
                This was new territory. And it mattered that we showed up well.

            <p>
                Once the confirmation came through, excitement quickly turned
                into responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                We didn’t just want to attend Re:Connect—we wanted to bring the
                conference to people who couldn’t be there. That meant one
                thing: going live.
            </p>
            <p>
                Up until this point, our setup had been simple and familiar. A
                controlled environment. A quiet room. Minimal variables. But now
                we were talking about live streaming from a stadium, with guests
                walking in and out, time constraints, noise, pressure, and no
                second takes.
            </p>
            <p>To make it happen, we had to level up—fast.</p>
            <p>
                We introduced new tools into our workflow, most notably OBS, to
                handle live streaming directly to YouTube. There was a learning
                curve, and more than a few “are we sure this will work?”
                moments. Thankfully, with the help of Kevin and Rachel, we were
                able to run test sessions, iron out issues, and gain enough
                confidence to trust the setup.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also decided to design and print custom t-shirts as
                merchandise—something small, but symbolic. This wasn’t just
                another episode. This was a milestone. And we wanted to mark it
                properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was our first opportunity of this scale, and we were
                determined not to waste it.

                The Day Arrives: Setting Up at the Stadium
            </h1>
            <p>
                We arrived early—earlier than necessary, but exactly when we
                needed to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our podcast space was set inside one of the VIP boxes,
                overlooking the pitch and the stands. The view alone was enough
                to stop you in your tracks for a moment. But there wasn’t much
                time to soak it in—we had work to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                We began setting up immediately. Cameras, microphones, lighting,
                streaming checks. There were challenges—as expected—but nothing
                that stopped us. A few test recordings later, everything was
                running smoothly. Then came the waiting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rachel was tracking the keynote speaker, Kevlin Henney,
                following his movement after his talk. Meanwhile, I was doing
                what I always do before an interview—researching. Reading about
                Kevlin’s journey, his philosophy, his work, and the ideas he
                cares deeply about. We wanted the conversation to feel
                thoughtful, not transactional.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Kevlin finally walked into the room, his first reaction
                said it all—surprise, curiosity, and genuine interest. A full
                podcast setup at a conference wasn’t something he expected.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were already recording. All that was left to do was go live.
            </p>
            <p>And we did.</p>

            <hr className="w-full h-0.5 bg-gray-300"></hr>

            <h1 className="font-bold ">Conversations That Matter</h1>
            <p>
                The conversation with Kevlin was everything we hoped it would
                be—calm, reflective, and deeply insightful. He spoke openly
                about his journey, his evolution into a multi-disciplined
                technologist, and the values that have guided his career.
            </p>
            <p>It didn’t feel rushed. It didn’t feel forced. It felt human.</p>
            <p>
                The feedback that followed—from Kevlin himself and from the
                organisers—was incredibly encouraging. It affirmed that we
                weren’t just “doing a podcast at a conference,” but creating a
                space where meaningful conversations could happen.
            </p>
            <p>After that first recording, the momentum carried us forward.</p>
            <p>
                We had the pleasure of sitting down with Marina Pellufo from
                Prima, Jonathan from Equal IT, and several students from
                Bournemouth University. The student conversations, in
                particular, were refreshing—full of curiosity, honesty, and
                ambition. It was a reminder of why spaces like Re:Connect matter
                so much.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each conversation felt different, yet connected by a shared
                theme: people building, learning, and navigating technology with
                purpose.

                Reflections: What Re:Connect Meant to Us
            </h1>
            <p>
                By the end of the day, over 150 people had attended the
                conference. Many stopped by our setup, asked questions, shared
                encouragement, or simply observed. The feedback we
                received—about the podcast, the conversations, and the
                energy—meant more than we can properly put into words.
            </p>
            <p>
                Re:Connect wasn’t just successful as an event. For us, it was
                proof of growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                It showed us that what started as an idea between two people
                could evolve into something larger—something that belongs in
                rooms like this. It pushed us outside our comfort zone and
                reminded us that progress often begins the moment you say yes to
                something that feels slightly terrifying.
            </p>
            <hr className="w-full h-0.5 bg-gray-300"></hr>

            <h1 className="font-bold ">Looking Ahead</h1>
            <p>We left Re:Connect inspired, grateful, and hungry for more.</p>
            <p>
                We hope to be back next year—stronger, more refined, and ready
                to push boundaries even further. And who knows? Maybe one day we
                won’t just attend conferences.
            </p>
            <p>Maybe we’ll host one.</p>
            <p>For now, we keep building. One conversation at a time.</p>
